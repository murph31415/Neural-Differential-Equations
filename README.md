# Neural-Differential-Equations
This repository contains implementations of **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** and **Neural Ordinary/Partial Differential Equation (NODE/NPDE)** solvers.   The primary research goal is to demonstrate the viability of deep learning architectures for solving boundary value problems (BVPs) and initial value problems (IVPs).
